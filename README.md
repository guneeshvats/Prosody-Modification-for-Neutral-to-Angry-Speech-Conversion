# Prosody Modification: Neutral to Angry Speech Conversion

A project to transform neutral speech into an angry-sounding version using prosody modification techniques. By leveraging signal processing, we enhance the pitch and intensity characteristics typically associated with angry speech.

## 🔧 How It Works

Our approach involves:

1. **Frame Division**: We divide the speech signal into frames using windowing.
2. **Voiced/Unvoiced Separation**: Voiced frames are identified using an energy threshold, as these contain pitch and most of the energy increase during angry speech.
3. **Phase Vocoder**: Voiced frames undergo pitch and duration modification through time-scaling and pitch-shifting using the phase vocoder.
4. **Pitch Enhancement**: Pitch is increased and the duration is shortened to emulate angry speech characteristics.

The phase vocoder operates on smaller subframes, utilizing a Hanning window to minimize distortion.
